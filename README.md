# smbcat
smbcat (or smbcataloguer) is a Domain Services enumeration tool inspired by [enum4linux](https://github.com/portcullislabs/enum4linux) and built around the [impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/) package. While still in development it is capable of enumerating users through a NULL session and retrieving some DC information.


Future features:
  - SID cycling
  - NT and NTML dumps
  - LSAD SID cycling
